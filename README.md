# VLSI PROJECTS

## Introduction
This repository serves as a showcase of my coursework in VLSI Design. Throughout the course, I designed various digital circuits using VLSI principles, and this repository contains the implementations of those designs.

## Circuit Designs
Here is a list of the digital circuits designed and implemented:

1. **NOT Gate**
2. **2 Input NOR Gate**
3. **2 Input NAND Gate**
4. **2 Input XOR Gate**
5. **3 Input XOR Gate**
6. **Half Adder**
7. **Full Adder**
8. **8 Bit Full Adder**

Each circuit design has been carefully crafted to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in VLSI design principles. Below, you can find brief descriptions of each circuit.

### Circuit Descriptions:

1. **NOT Gate**: The NOT gate inverts the input signal, i.e., if the input is true, the output is false, and vice versa.
2. **2 Input NOR Gate**: A NOR gate outputs true only when both of its inputs are false; otherwise, it outputs false.
3. **2 Input NAND Gate**: A NAND gate outputs false only when both of its inputs are true; otherwise, it outputs true.
4. **2 Input XOR Gate**: This gate produces an output that is true only when the inputs are different.
5. **3 Input XOR Gate**: This gate takes three inputs and produces an output that is true only when exactly one of the inputs is true.
6. **Half Adder**: A half adder adds two binary digits and generates a sum and a carry.
7. **Full Adder**: The full adder is designed to add two binary numbers along with a carry input and produce a sum and a carry output.
8. **8 Bit Full Adder**: An 8-bit full adder is designed to perform addition of two 8-bit binary numbers along with a carry-in from the previous stage and generate a sum along with a carry-out.
