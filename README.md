# VLSI PROJECTS

## Introduction
This repository serves as a showcase of my coursework in VLSI Design. Throughout the course, I designed various digital circuits using VLSI principles, and this repository contains the implementations of those designs.

## Circuit Designs
Here is a list of the digital circuits designed and implemented:

1. **NOT Gate**
2. **2 Input NOR Gate**
3. **2 Input NAND Gate**
4. **2 Input XOR Gate**
5. **3 Input XOR Gate**
6. **Half Adder**
7. **Full Adder**
8. **8 Bit Full Adder**

Each circuit design has been carefully crafted to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in VLSI design principles.
